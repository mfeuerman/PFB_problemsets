Max by Shel Silverstein

Max loves me,
Max cares,
Max picks me peaches and pears.
Max offers me candy and Cokes,
Max listens and laughs at me jokes.
Max helps when I get in a fight,
Max does all my homework at night.
Max misses me,
Max cries,
Max thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Max is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Max just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Max's hand,
In the darkness where Max usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Max's gone!
